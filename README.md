# gmmreg-python
Python implementation of "Robust Point Set Registration Using Gaussian Mixture Models" by Jian &amp; Vemuri, PAMI'11.

Please note that we have another [github repo](https://github.com/bing-jian/gmmreg) that contains C++ implementation and 
more info about this point set registration work.

Run the following steps to download, install and demo the library:
  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/bing-jian/gmmreg-python.git
  cd gmmreg-python/src
  python setup.py install
  cd ../data
  python ../demo.py ./fish_partial.ini
  ```
